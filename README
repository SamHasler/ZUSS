ZUSS (ZK User-interface Style Sheet) is an extension to CSS.
ZUSS is backward compatible with CSS, while extending it with variables, mixins,
nested rules, expressions, and Java methods with existing CSS syntax.

Design Goals

* Extend CSS to make it easy to write sophisticated CSS rules
* High performance server-side processing with small foot print
* Seamlessly integration with Java without the need of JavaScript interpreter

The first implementation is Java, and it depends nothing but JDK.
It shall be straighforward to port to different languages.
